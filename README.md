# KeyBindings

##### This is my private key bindings in Xcode.

## Usage

1. First go to the directory. 

```shell
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData
```

2. Then clone the whole repo into local. 

Make sure that there is no directory with the same name `KeyBindings`. If exists, save the contents in that directory and paste them back into the `KeyBindings` directory after clone.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:archmagees/KeyBindings.git
```

3. Restart the Xcode. Now you can use the added code snippets.
